Concept of Operation
================================================================================
### Background
The [Little Free Library][lfl] organization expands access to information by
providing access to physical books.

#### Principles
* Access is local
    * you must physically take/add a book
* Access is anonymous
    * no one knows whether you took/added a book

Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project provides a digital version of the [Little Free Library][lfl].
* Access is local
    * nodes are open WiFi accesspoints (disconnected from the internet)
* Access is anonymous
    * no data about the user is stored

Content Management (Curation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, any user can add content. As well, content can be removed by
any user. In this way, objectionable content is locally curated.

For node creators that want more control, folders can be LOCKED - allowing
only the admin to add/remove content.
