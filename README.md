Free Library
================================================================================
The [Little Free Library][lfl] organization expands access to information by
providing access to physical books.

This project provides digital content directly to local users
(i.e. a digital library decoupled from the internet).

How is digital content provided to users?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as Little Free Library participants build book cases, here you'll be able
to build an inexpensive hardware device that provides digital content over Wifi
(see [Concept of Operation](docs/conops.md)).

Anyone can create one
================================================================================
Detailed instructions will be provided on how to create your own Free Library node.
